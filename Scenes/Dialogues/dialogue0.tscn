M:Those who don't see existence the way I do, those who choose not to follow me are doomed. That's what I did for...
M:You said it yourself: I have been guardian angel several times. I learned that it's a dull task. I have no time for such things.. It is time for me to change how this works..
G:You haven't killed us yet! I'm not letting you go. I'll do whatever is in my powers to stop you!
M:You don't seem to understand, Gabriel. You are dead.
G:Henry... Listen to me...
H:Huh?
G:You have just been murdered by Michael's Troops. You are in the edge of death, but I can stop it. I can bring you back to life.. I need to.. You are the only hope.. I'm sorry....
